\usage{
display.clusters(clust, Net, zoom = NA, type = 1, cols = c("yellow",
  "black", "red", "green"), col = cols[type + 1], ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{clust}{a matrix which is the output1 of \code{cluster.network}}

\item{Net}{an igraph object}

\item{zoom}{an integer to define the size of plot or NA, to plot all clusters}

\item{type}{0 = "yellow", 1 = "black", 2="red", 3 = "green"}

\item{cols}{a list of 4 colors if you want to change the default colors}

\item{col}{color to use with zoom}

\item{...}{Additional plotting parameters}
}
\description{
Graphical representation of the network clusters.
Given a cluster matrix, see \code{cluster.network}, and a network
display the cluster matrix with the following colors for the position (i,j):
}
\details{
- Yellow if the protein and protein i doesn't belongs to cluster of protein j and
proteins don't interact in the network

-  Black if the protein and protein i belongs to cluster of protein j but
proteins don't interact in the network

- Red if the protein and protein i doesn't belongs to cluster of protein j but
proteins interact in the network

-  Green if the protein and protein i belongs to cluster of protein j and
proteins interact in the network

This function has a \code{zoom} option, to reduce the number of squares that are drawn.
In this case the user has to select one of the colors, and the color will represent the
average of the values of the matrix in that square.
